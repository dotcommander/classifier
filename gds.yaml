# Generic Directory System Template (gds-generic-template.yaml)
#
# This is a template demonstrating a hierarchical file organization system.
# Customize it to fit your own needs.
#
# Key Concepts:
#   - Keys (e.g., "01_Projects") define category names/codes.
#   - Nesting creates the hierarchy (e.g., "01_Projects"/"Work").
#   - `_valid: true` marks a category as a valid target for file classification.
#     Files will only be placed in directories marked as valid.
#   - `_description:` provides the semantic meaning for the category, used by the AI
#     to match files. Write clear, descriptive text here for best results.
#   - Categories without `_valid: true` act as organizational parents.
